# Initiative Society Client

It is the client part of the [project](https://github.com/ZitRos/initiative-society), which is used as git a submodule.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
Or also you can type `npm run start` if you don't have Angular installed in your local machine. 

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` (or `npm run build`) to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `-prod` flag for a production build.
